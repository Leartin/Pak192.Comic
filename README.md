# Pak192.Comic
Pakset and Theme for Simutrans

To compile under unix, run the "COMPILE.sh". Make sure you are able to run makeobj. There might be libaries missing.

To compile under windows, run the "COMPILE_win.sh" OR the "COMPILE.ps1" via PowerShell.

After that, copy the folder named "compiled" in your usual Simutrans game folder.
Start Simutrans the way you did before, and you'll see a menu asking you for a pakset to run. Select "compiled" to run this pakset.
You can always rename the "folder" from compiled to something else, it being named "compiled" is jsut the default name of it.
