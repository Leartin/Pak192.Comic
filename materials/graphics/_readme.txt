The graphics directory is meant for textures and elements to be repeatedly used in pak192comic.

As there is no associated dat-file, there is no specific author given for these graphics.
For use outside the pakset, please attribute pak192.comic in authors stead.
For use within the pakset, you are not required to attribute anyone. This is a slight deviation from the pakset license for convenience sake.


When you supply graphics/textures here, please stick to a 192x192 grid, for smaller objects use a 48x48 grid.
If possible, seasonal variations should be arranged vertically in order. 
Backgrounds should be either fully transparent or solid #E7FFFF. You may use #E7FFFF on fully transparent to supply information within the graphic.
Note that the same author-less-nes applies, contributions here will not carry your name.
