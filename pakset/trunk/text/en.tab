cur_city_basil_cathedral
Saint Basil's Cathedral\n\nThis church is officially known as "Cathedral of the Intercession of the Most Holy Theotokos on the Moat". However, it's the cities most famous landmark, and the ministry of tourism decided a shorter name is more marketable.
cur_city_gothic_cathedral
Gothic Cathedral\n\n By far the best part about any gothic building are the flying buttresses.\nOn one hand, they are the architectural marvel which distributes weights in such a way that thick walls are not needed, which in turn allows for those large windows typical for gothic architecture.\nOn the other hand, if you don't know your builders jargon, it just evokes the funniest pictures in your head. For those lacking any kind of imagination: A bunch of female asses with wings. Not the donkey kind.
mon_at_at
AT-AT\n\nThe All Terrain Armored Transport is a quadruped mechanized infantry combat vehicle used by the Imperial ground forces. Standing over 20 meters tall with blast-impervious armour plating, these massive constructs are used as much for psychological effect as they are for tactical advantage. In this case though, it's just a statue to celebrate Star Wars Day. May the Fourth be with you!
mon_brose
Monument to Alexander Brose\n\nAlex. Brose is a world-class pixel artist, who left his mark not only in P192C. The monument shows one of the building-breeders, a machine which grows stray pixels into magnificent skyscrapers. Sadly, only Mr. Brose can operate it.
mon_coot
Cornelius Coot\n\nThe oversized statue was founded in 1952 to honor the cities founder, Cornelius Coot. It was financed by the richest inhabitant, who aimed to trump the Maharaja of Howdoyustans slightly smaller statue. The prominently placed corn reminds us of their important part in victory over spanish invaders.\n The duck was a misunderstanding. The sculptor Carl Barks and his assistent Don Rosa were only told to "Show Coot costumed as a pioneer holding cobs of corn", no further instructions or feedback.
mon_cruzer
Cruzer-Monument\n\nA monument to honor Cruzer, creator and founder of pak192.com. Withouth him, this would not be possible.
mon_cube
Rubik's Cube\n\nThis mechanical monstrosity is dedicated to the famous puzzle as well as others of it's kind, which tend to stress the mental capabilities of young and old alike. Hardly anyone notices how the sculpture is cheating.
mon_flemm
Monument for Flemmbrav\n\nThis monument is dedicated to Flemmbrav, who enriched Simuthania with many things, most of which were rail-bound vehicles ins all shapes, sizes and colors.\nIt shows a true masterpiece of flemmbravian engineering. Unfortunatly the speed control is rusted, so a countermoving platform was buildt to keep this 'BR 61', a locomotive of the Henschel-Wegmann-Train, in place.
mon_incredible_cube
Incredible Cube\n\nA monument to honor the developers of Simutrans.
mon_leartin
Monument for Leartin\n\nThis is a small interactive version of most of Leartin's fantastic landscape creations. Only the trains aren't his work, but tourists wouldn't like playing with them half as much if it wasn't for the beautyful environment.\n
mon_ptm1
PappeTeeMaster monument\n\nA monument in honor PappeTeeMaster, the current pak maintainer and creator of many great buildings and vehicles, without the pak192.comic would not be so great today.
mon_rings
Monument to a wedding\n\nOriginally this monument was errected to honour some marriage, but since then, the plaque got removed, so you wouldn't know what it was about. Alas, those who need to know already know.
mon_tree
Jungle Tree\n\nWhen this tree was planted the authorities did not yet know that it's a protected species which can grow a few hundred meters in heights. By now the growth is managable, but give it a few hundred years and it should look down even on the LearTower.
mon_werniman
Nightly-Monument\n\nTo honor Wernieman for supplying daily nightly Simutrans versions.

Residentials\n\nMrs. Finkelstein in 2C recently bought a new doormat. It showed a happy white sheep on a green meadow under a bright blue sky. Within a day she received a note from Management.
